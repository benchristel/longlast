# clone-worktree creates a copy of this git repository, including any untracked
# files and uncommited changes in the working tree. It outputs the path to the
# clone.
#
# The purpose of clone-worktree is to create a sandbox for running tests on a
# modified version of the repository. For example, a cloned worktree can be
# used to test whether the code typechecks with a particular version of
# TypeScript, or whether a package works with a specific dependency version
# other than the one in pnpm-lock.yaml.
